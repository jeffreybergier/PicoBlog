PicoBlog
========

Decentralized, subscription based, microblogging. Its Twitter without a central server or any central control.

## Problem
Many nerds are upset about how Social Media networks work right now. Twitter, Facebook and Google all control a central system where you give them your data and they display and sell your to advertisers. 

## Attempted Solution
App.net tried to solve this by charging for a social network. By charging, the users could be the customers instead of advertisers. While they didn’t sell user information to advertisers, they replicated the technology of the traditional networks. A central system that collects and displays user data. The problem with this system is it costs money to run all the central servers and maintain the software.

## A Different Solution
Pico Blog will take a cue from the old world of the internet. The technology model is closer to that of a self hosted website/blog and a subscription service like an RSS aggregator. To use the network, you host a file that contains all of your “tweets” wherever you want. For someone to “follow” you, they put the URL to this file in PicoBlog. PicoBlog downloads and displays all the subscriptions in a twitter like UI.
